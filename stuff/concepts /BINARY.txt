# binary will work using a 3 line syntax,

    - the first line will be the command / instruction, for example the ADD command in assembly.
        - this is written as  0000,0010
    - the second line is the first arguement of the program, for example, for the ADD statement, it will be the location of a register
        - for example,  0000,0001
    - the third line is either a second arguement, or it is simply 0, in which case the line is ignored or gives an error if the command takes 2 arguements
        - for example,  0000,0010

    - these three lines perform a binary add on the values from register 1 and register 2 and then will automatically send that to the accumulator
        - this entire command can be written as:
        00000010
        00000001
        00000010
        - even though lines 1 and 3 are the same value, they both do different things depending on the state of the processor at the time.
        - what this essentially means is that the system uses a 3 step process to execute instructions.
        - the processor will fetch 3 lines of binary at a time from program memory.
        - each first line of binary out will be execute with the other 2 as arguements,
        - if the command entered has less than 2 arguements the ones that dont exist will be zeros and will be ignored anyway
        - the first line of the binary will show the processor the command
        - the second line specifies the adresss to take from
        - the third line specifies the address to copy to
