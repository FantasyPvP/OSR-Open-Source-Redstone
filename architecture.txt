# program architecture: (WIP)
# when using numbers in this documentation i will be using Hexadecimal 
# this is becausee it is similar to binary but more conventient to read and write by a human. the compiler will convert it to binary to run.


first we need a way to move files between different registers, 
    - on each instruction cycle the computer will automatically load the next instruction from the program that it is working on
    - this program will be stored in a register called the CPR (current program register)
    - this will be a 16 bit register storing the ROM port that the instruction is being called from.
    - this means that when we want to jump to another instruction, the system can take the value from the CPR and use it to call the required
      ROM module and address.
    - to move files between registers we will use the ">" symbol to indicate the direction of data flow for example:

      RAM-01 > REG-01 





# registers:
    - CPR - current program register, stores the ROM address of the current program being executed
    - PC - stores the current ROM address for the operating system so when you exit a program it can pick up where it left off
    - ACC - accumulator - stores the output of the ALU
    - REG-1, REG-2, ... REG-16 - general purpose registers for storing data that is currently in use and performing calculations / functions

    - RAM - stores data that needs to be kept for later when the program exits
    - ROM - stores program instructions that a program can iterate through when it is run.
    - HDD - stores data that is saved permanently (will use a text file eventually for the python program not sure about mc though)




assembly code structure

binary [hex] assembly [args] (usage)

0000,0001 [01] MVE [source "->" destination] (moves the value from the first location to the second location)
0000,0010 [02] ADD [primary "+" secondary]   (adds the first value to the second value and saves to accumulator)
0000,0010 [03] SUB [primary "-" secondary]   (subtracts the second value from the first value)
0000,0010 [04] SFT [number "<>" shift]       (binary shifts the value to the left or right by a certain amount)
0000,0010 [05] JMP [location]                (loads the next instruction from the specified memory location)
0000,0010 [06] CND [location]                (skips next line if false, proceeds sequentially if true, statement will evaluate based on the value of the memory location)
